      <h1>Continuous Delivery</h1>
      <div class="meta">Continuously deliver software in small increments with automated testing and deployment to improve quality and speed of delivery.</div>

      <section id="key-aspects">
        <h2>Key aspects</h2>
        <p>Version Control: Effective use of version control systems, such as Git, to track and manage changes to source code, enabling collaboration, traceability, and easy rollback to previous versions.</p>
        <p>Work in Small Batches: Breaking down work into small, manageable units or user stories, allowing for faster feedback, reduced risk, and easier prioritization and deployment.</p>
        <p>Limit Work In-Progress (WIP): Focusing on completing and delivering work before taking on new tasks, preventing bottlenecks and improving productivity by reducing multitasking and context switching.</p>
        <p>Adhering to Coding Standards: Following agreed-upon coding conventions and best practices within the development team, promoting consistency, readability, maintainability, and reducing bugs and technical debt.</p>
        <p>Trunk-Based Development: Promoting a development approach where all developers work on a single branch (the "trunk") for faster integration and reduced merge conflicts, enabling continuous integration and shorter release cycles.</p>
        <p>Loosely Coupled Architecture: Designing software systems with loosely coupled components that interact through well-defined interfaces, allowing for flexibility, maintainability, and scalability.</p>
        <p>Continuous Integration: Regularly integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository, facilitating early bug detection, faster feedback, and enabling automated testing and deployment.</p>
        <p>Feature toggles: Decoupling deployments from product releases, applications are deployable with more flexibility as business dependencies are detached from deployments and impact on deployment can be controlled.</p>
        <p>Shift Left on Quality: Emphasizing early and continuous testing throughout the development lifecycle, starting from requirements gathering to development and deployment, to ensure high-quality software.</p>
        <p>Test Automation: Automating the execution of tests to validate software functionality, performance, and security, enabling faster and more reliable regression testing and freeing up resources for more critical tasks.</p>
        <p>Test Data Management: Efficiently managing and provisioning test data for testing environments, ensuring data integrity, repeatability, and sufficient coverage of different scenarios.</p>
        <p>Deployment Automation: Automating the process of deploying software to various environments, such as development, testing, and production, reducing manual errors, and enabling frequent and reliable deployments.</p>
        <p>Shift Left on Security and Privacy: Incorporating security and privacy considerations throughout the development lifecycle, starting from requirements, design, coding, and testing, to proactively address vulnerabilities and protect user data.</p>
        <p>Lightweight Change Approval: Implementing streamlined and efficient change approval processes to minimize bureaucracy and delays while ensuring appropriate oversight and control.</p>
        <p>Proactive Notification on Build and Deployment Process: Implementing automated notifications and alerts to keep the team and stakeholders informed about the progress, issues, and status of builds and deployments.</p>
        <p>Monitoring and Obtaining Feedback from Production: Implementing monitoring and logging mechanisms to collect data and insights from the production environment, enabling proactive issue detection, performance optimization, and continuous improvement.</p>
        <p>Make Flow of Work Visible to Team and Customer: Utilizing visual tools, such as Kanban boards, to provide transparency and visibility into the status and progress of work items, facilitating collaboration and shared understanding.</p>
        <p>Visual Management of Current Application Production, Build, and Deployment State: Using visual dashboards or tools to provide real-time visibility into the state of the application, builds, and deployments, helping teams identify bottlenecks and address issues promptly.</p>
        <p>Empowered Teams: Fostering a culture of autonomy, trust, and ownership, where teams have the authority and responsibility to make decisions, experiment, and continuously improve their processes and outcomes.</p>
        <p>Team Experimentation: Encouraging teams to experiment with new tools, techniques, and approaches, fostering innovation, learning, and the identification of better ways of working.</p>
        <p>Continuous Delivery: Striving to deliver software frequently, reliably, and with minimal manual intervention, enabling rapid feedback, faster time to market, and increased customer satisfaction.</p>
        <p>Communication and Collaboration Skills: Emphasizing effective communication, active listening, and collaboration within and across teams, fostering shared understanding, alignment, and successful outcomes.</p>
        <p>Continuous Learning and Skill Development: Promoting a learning culture, providing opportunities for skill development, knowledge sharing, and staying updated with emerging technologies and industry trends.</p>
        <p>Agile Methodologies and Practices: Embracing agile principles and methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, to enable iterative development, adaptability to change, and customer-centricity.</p>
        <p>Culture of Collaboration: Continuous Delivery requires a culture of collaboration and communication within the software team and across different stakeholders. It encourages close collaboration between developers, testers, operations teams, and product owners, promoting shared ownership and responsibility for the software's success.</p>

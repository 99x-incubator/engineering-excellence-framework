      <h1>Loosely Coupled Architecture</h1>
      <div class="meta">Loosely coupled architecture is a software engineering best practice that emphasizes the design and implementation of components that are independent and have minimal dependencies on each other. It promotes modularity, flexibility, and maintainability in software systems. By following the principles of loosely coupled architecture, software systems can become more modular, flexible, and maintainable. It allows for easier development, testing, and evolution of software, leading to improved quality and long-term sustainability.</div>

      <section id="key-aspects">
        <h2>Key aspects covered by the practice</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Loosely coupled architecture encourages breaking down a system into smaller, independent modules or components. Each module focuses on a specific functionality and can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. This modular approach enables easier understanding, maintenance, and scalability of the system.</li>
          <li><strong>Minimized dependencies:</strong> In loosely coupled architecture, components have minimal dependencies on each other. They communicate through well-defined interfaces or contracts, allowing them to interact without being tightly bound. This reduces the impact of changes made to one component on the rest of the system, making it more resilient to modifications and updates.</li>
          <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Components in a loosely coupled architecture are encapsulated, meaning their internal workings are hidden from other components. This promotes information hiding and abstraction, enabling developers to modify or replace the implementation of a component without affecting the rest of the system. Encapsulation also helps in achieving separation of concerns and improving code maintainability.</li>
          <li><strong>Loose coupling techniques:</strong> Several techniques are used to achieve loose coupling in software architecture. These include dependency injection, where components are provided with their dependencies from external sources; event-driven communication, where components communicate through events or messages; and interfaces or contracts that define the interactions between components without exposing their internal details.</li>
          <li><strong>Testability:</strong> Loose coupling enhances the testability of a system. With independent modules, it becomes easier to isolate and test individual components in isolation. Mocking or stubbing dependencies becomes simpler, enabling more effective unit testing and easier identification of issues or bugs.</li>
          <li><strong>Scalability and flexibility:</strong> Loosely coupled architectures are more scalable and flexible. Adding or removing components can be done without disrupting the entire system. New features or functionalities can be introduced by integrating new modules without affecting the existing ones. This allows the system to adapt to changing requirements and enables future enhancements without major architectural changes.</li>
          <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Loosely coupled components can be easily reused in different contexts or projects. Since they have minimal dependencies and well-defined interfaces, they can be extracted and applied in other systems, promoting code reuse and reducing development effort.</li>
        </ul>

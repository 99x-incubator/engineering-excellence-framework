      <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Working in small batches is a software engineering best practice that emphasizes breaking down tasks and delivering them incrementally. It involves dividing work into small, manageable pieces and completing them in short cycles.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="key-aspects">
        <h2>Key aspects covered by the practice</h2>
        <p>Iterative Development: Working in small batches follows an iterative development approach, where software is developed and delivered in multiple iterations or increments. Each iteration typically spans a few days to a few weeks and results in a potentially shippable product increment.</p>
        <p>Continuous Integration: Small batches promote frequent integration of code changes into a shared codebase through continuous integration practices. Developers regularly merge their work into a central repository, allowing early detection and resolution of integration issues.</p>
        <p>Rapid Feedback Loop: By working in small batches, developers can receive feedback on their work more frequently. This facilitates quick identification of issues, improves collaboration, and enables faster course corrections.</p>
        <p>Risk Mitigation: Breaking down work into small batches helps mitigate risks associated with software development. It allows teams to address potential challenges and obstacles early on, reducing the likelihood of significant delays or failures in the later stages of development.</p>
        <p>Flexibility and Adaptability: Small batches enable teams to be more flexible and adaptable to changing requirements. As each batch represents a smaller portion of the overall project, it becomes easier to adjust priorities, incorporate feedback, and respond to evolving customer needs.</p>
        <p>Continuous Delivery: With small batches, teams can aim for continuous delivery, where software can be deployed to production at any time. This practice ensures that software is always in a releasable state and can be delivered to end-users whenever needed.</p>
        <p>Quality Focus: Working in small batches facilitates a stronger focus on quality. By delivering smaller increments of functionality, teams can concentrate on thorough testing, code reviews, and other quality assurance practices, resulting in higher overall software quality.</p>
        <p>Reduced Time to Market: Small batches enable faster delivery of software features or improvements. By continuously delivering small increments of value, teams can reduce time to market and provide value to users sooner.</p>
        <p>Collaboration and Communication: Small batches encourage collaboration and effective communication within development teams. With smaller pieces of work, it becomes easier for team members to coordinate their efforts, share knowledge, and provide support to each other.</p>

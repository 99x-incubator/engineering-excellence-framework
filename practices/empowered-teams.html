      <h1>Empowered Teams</h1>
      <div class="meta">Empowered Teams is an approach that emphasizes the importance of empowering teams in software development projects. It promotes collaboration, autonomy, and accountability within the team members to achieve high-quality software solutions. With this approach organizations can foster a collaborative and innovative work environment that empowers individuals, promotes continuous learning, and drives successful software development projects.</div>

      <section id="key-aspects">
        <h2>Key aspects covered by the practice</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cross-functional teams:</strong> Empowered teams in software engineering consist of individuals with diverse skill sets, including developers, testers, designers, and product owners. This allows for better collaboration and promotes a shared understanding of the project goals and requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>Agile methodologies:</strong> The practice of empowered teams often aligns with Agile methodologies such as Scrum or Kanban. These methodologies emphasize iterative and incremental development, close customer collaboration, and continuous improvement. Agile practices enable teams to quickly respond to changing requirements and deliver value to customers in shorter cycles.</li>
          <li><strong>Self-organization:</strong> Empowered teams have the authority and autonomy to make decisions regarding the technical aspects of their work. They are responsible for organizing their work, setting their own priorities, and determining how to best achieve the project objectives. This autonomy fosters a sense of ownership and motivation within the team members.</li>
          <li><strong>Continuous learning:</strong> Software engineering best practice empowered teams prioritize continuous learning and improvement. Team members are encouraged to stay up-to-date with industry trends, new technologies, and emerging best practices. They also promote knowledge sharing within the team, fostering a culture of learning and growth.</li>
          <li><strong>Collaborative decision-making:</strong> Empowered teams encourage collaborative decision-making processes. Rather than relying on a top-down management approach, decisions are made collectively, involving all team members. This approach promotes a sense of ownership and buy-in, as everyone has a say in the decisions that affect the project.</li>
          <li><strong>Continuous integration and delivery:</strong> Empowered teams strive for frequent integration of code changes and continuous delivery of working software. They adopt practices such as automated testing, continuous integration, and deployment pipelines to ensure that software updates can be quickly and reliably delivered to users.</li>
          <li><strong>Transparent communication:</strong> Effective communication is crucial for empowered teams. They promote transparent and open communication channels, both within the team and with stakeholders. Regular meetings, such as daily stand-ups and sprint reviews, are conducted to share progress, discuss challenges, and align on project goals.</li>
          <li><strong>Retrospectives and feedback:</strong> Empowered teams regularly conduct retrospectives to reflect on their work processes, identify areas for improvement, and implement changes. They encourage feedback loops from customers and stakeholders to continuously enhance the quality of the software and meet user expectations.</li>

            <tr><td>EMTR-9</td><td>Low employee morale</td><td>When team members lack empowerment, it can result in low morale and job dissatisfaction, leading to increased turnover, reduced productivity, and negative impacts on the overall team dynamics.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>EMTR-10</td><td>Decreased product quality</td><td>Without empowered teams, there may be a lack of collective ownership and responsibility for the quality of the product. This can result in a decline in product quality, increased defects, and reduced customer satisfaction.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>EMTR-11</td><td>Unauthorized software usage</td><td>This risk refers to the use of unlicensed or unauthorized software within the software product engineering team. When unauthorized software is used, it can lead to legal and security issues, including copyright infringement, malware infections, and lack of vendor support. It is important to mitigate this risk by ensuring that all software used in product development is properly licensed and authorized.</td></tr>

      <h1>Visual Management of Current Application Production, Build, and Deployment State</h1>
      <div class="meta">Visual management of the current application production, build, and deployment state is a methodology that focuses on providing a visual representation of the state of an application throughout its production, build, and deployment processes. This practice aims to enhance visibility, collaboration, and decision-making within software development teams. This approach enables teams to quickly identify issues, prioritize work, and communicate effectively with team members and stakeholders.</div>

      <section id="key-aspects">
        <h2>Key aspects covered by the practice</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Real-time visualizations:</strong> The practice emphasizes creating visual representations, such as dashboards or Kanban boards, that reflect the current state of the application's production, build, and deployment processes. These visualizations should be updated in real-time to provide the most accurate and up-to-date information.</li>
          <li><strong>Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD):</strong> The practice integrates with CI/CD pipelines to monitor and display the status of various stages, including code commits, automated tests, builds, and deployments. It helps identify bottlenecks, track progress, and quickly address any issues that may arise during these processes.</li>
          <li><strong>Status indicators:</strong> Visual management techniques employ status indicators, such as color-coded cards or icons, to represent the state of different components or stages of the application. For example, green may indicate a successful deployment, yellow may denote a warning or pending action, and red may signify a failed or blocked state.</li>
          <li><strong>Information transparency:</strong> The practice promotes transparency by making relevant information easily accessible to all team members. This includes providing visibility into the status of individual features, user stories, bugs, and associated tasks. Team members can quickly grasp the current state of the application and make informed decisions based on this shared understanding.</li>
          <li><strong>Collaboration and communication:</strong> Visual management facilitates collaboration and communication among team members. It encourages discussions around the application's state, helps identify dependencies or blockers, and enables team members to coordinate their efforts more effectively. By visualizing the workflow, teams can prioritize tasks, plan work, and optimize resource allocation.</li>
          <li><strong>Metrics and analytics:</strong> The practice leverages metrics and analytics to gain insights into the performance and health of the software development process. These metrics can include build times, deployment frequency, defect rates, and customer feedback. Visual representations of these metrics enable teams to identify trends, evaluate the effectiveness of their practices, and make data-driven improvements.</li>
          <li><strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> Visual management encourages a culture of continuous improvement by fostering transparency and enabling teams to identify areas for optimization. It provides a platform for retrospectives, where teams can reflect on past performance, discuss challenges, and brainstorm ideas to enhance their development processes.</li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Working in small batches is a software engineering best practice that emphasizes breaking down tasks and delivering them incrementally. It involves dividing work into small, manageable pieces and completing them in short cycles.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="key-aspects">
        <h2>Key aspects covered by the practice</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Iterative Development:</strong> Deliver in short iterations that produce potentially shippable increments.</li>
          <li><strong>Continuous Integration:</strong> Integrate frequently to detect issues early.</li>
          <li><strong>Rapid Feedback Loop:</strong> Get feedback quickly to make course corrections.</li>
          <li><strong>Risk Mitigation:</strong> Reduce large, risky changes by addressing challenges early.</li>
          <li><strong>Flexibility and Adaptability:</strong> Easier to reprioritize and adapt to changing requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>Continuous Delivery:</strong> Aim for always-releasable software.</li>
          <li><strong>Quality Focus:</strong> Emphasize testing and reviews on smaller slices of work.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduced Time to Market:</strong> Deliver incremental value faster.</li>
          <li><strong>Collaboration and Communication:</strong> Improve team coordination and knowledge sharing.</li>
        </ul>

          <tbody>
            <tr><td>WSBR-1</td><td>Poor Feedback Loop — lack of frequent feedback leads to late issue discovery.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>WSBR-2</td><td>Increased Integration Challenges — large merges and fragile integrations.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>WSBR-3</td><td>Limited Adaptability — hard to change course quickly.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>WSBR-4</td><td>Higher Risk of Project Failure — issues not surfaced early.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>WSBR-5</td><td>Delayed Time to Market — bigger tasks take longer to deliver value.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>WSBR-6</td><td>Decreased Collaboration — silos form around large tasks.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>WSBR-7</td><td>Inefficient Testing and Debugging — harder to test large changes.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>WSBR-8</td><td>Reduced Flexibility — inability to respond to feedback quickly.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>WSBR-9</td><td>Lower Productivity — longer lead times and increased complexity.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>WSBR-10</td><td>Decreased Customer Satisfaction — slower delivery of value.</td></tr>

        <h2>Guidelines / Work Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>WSBG-1 - Break Work into Small Tasks:</strong> Identify larger tasks and break them down into smaller units that can be completed in a few days.</li>
          <li><strong>WSBG-2 - Define Clear Acceptance Criteria:</strong> Collaborate with stakeholders to set unambiguous acceptance criteria (functional, non-functional, security, performance).</li>
          <li><strong>WSBG-3 - Prioritize and Sequence Tasks:</strong> Order tasks based on dependencies and business value.</li>
          <li><strong>WSBG-4 - Implement Continuous Integration:</strong> Set up automated builds, tests, and reviews triggered by changes.</li>
          <li><strong>WSBG-5 - Perform Regular Code Reviews:</strong> Establish review practices to improve quality.</li>
          <li><strong>WSBG-6 - Adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD):</strong> Write tests before features to ensure quality.</li>
          <li><strong>WSBG-7 - Automate Build and Deployment Processes:</strong> Automate CI/CD to support frequent delivery.</li>
          <li><strong>WSBG-8 - Encourage Pair Programming:</strong> Promote collaboration and knowledge sharing.</li>
          <li><strong>WSBG-9 - Conduct Retrospectives and Act on Feedback:</strong> Continuously improve via retrospectives.</li>
          <li><strong>WSBG-10 - Maintain a Prioritized and Flexible Backlog:</strong> Keep a backlog prioritized by business value and revisit it regularly.</li>

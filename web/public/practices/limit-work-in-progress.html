      <h1>Limit Work In-Progress (WIP)</h1>
      <div class="meta">Limiting Work In-Progress (WIP) helps teams maintain focus and flow by controlling how many items are actively worked on.</div>

      <section>
        <h2>Definition & Benefits</h2>
        <p>Limiting Work In-Progress (WIP) is a software engineering best practice aimed at managing and controlling the amount of work that is actively being worked on at any given time. It is a key aspect of agile methodologies such as Kanban and Lean Software Development. By limiting Work In-Progress, software engineering teams can achieve better flow, reduce multitasking, enhance collaboration, and improve the overall quality and efficiency of their work. It is a valuable practice for managing workloads, maintaining focus, and continuously improving development processes.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="key-aspects">
        <h2>Key aspects covered by the practice</h2>
        <p>Definition: Limiting WIP involves setting a maximum limit on the number of tasks or user stories that can be in progress simultaneously. This limit is determined based on the team's capacity and the goal is to prevent overloading and maintain focus.</p>
        <p>Reduces Multitasking: By limiting WIP, teams avoid multitasking, where individuals switch between multiple tasks frequently. Multitasking can lead to decreased productivity, increased context switching, and longer lead times. By focusing on completing a limited number of tasks before starting new ones, teams can achieve better flow and efficiency.</p>
        <p>Enhances Flow and Throughput: Limiting WIP helps maintain a smooth flow of work through the development process. It prevents bottlenecks and congestion by ensuring that tasks are completed before new ones are started. This, in turn, leads to improved throughput and faster delivery of valuable software increments.</p>
        <p>Encourages Collaboration: When team members are not overwhelmed with excessive workloads, they have more opportunities to collaborate effectively. Limiting WIP promotes teamwork, knowledge sharing, and collective problem-solving. It encourages individuals to support each other and work together towards common goals.</p>
        <p>Visualize and Identify Blockers: By visualizing the work items on a Kanban board or similar tool, teams can easily identify bottlenecks and blockers in the development process. If work items are piling up in a specific column or stage, it indicates potential issues that need to be addressed promptly. This visibility allows for quicker response times and proactive problem-solving.</p>
        <p>Improves Focus and Quality: When teams are limited to a specific number of tasks, they can focus their attention and efforts on delivering high-quality results. It allows for thorough testing, reviews, and quality assurance practices, resulting in better overall software quality.</p>
        <p>Facilitates Continuous Improvement: Limiting WIP promotes a culture of continuous improvement. Teams can monitor their performance metrics, such as lead time and cycle time, and make data-driven decisions to optimize their processes. By experimenting with WIP limits and adapting them over time, teams can refine their workflows and achieve higher levels of productivity.</p>

      <h1>Trunk-Based Development</h1>
      <div class="meta">Trunk-Based Development (TBD) is a software engineering best practice that emphasizes frequent integration into a shared mainline (trunk) to reduce long-lived branches and accelerate delivery.</div>

      <section id="overview">
        <p>Trunk-Based Development (TBD) is a software engineering best practice that emphasizes frequent integration of code changes into a shared codebase, often referred to as the "trunk" or "mainline." This approach aims to minimize long-lived branches and promote collaboration among developers. By following Trunk-Based Development practices, development teams can reduce the complexity of branching and merging, increase collaboration, improve code quality, and accelerate the delivery of new features. However, it's important to note that the suitability of TBD may vary depending on the project's size, team structure, and specific requirements.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="key-aspects">
        <h2>Key aspects covered by the practice</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Continuous Integration (CI):</strong> TBD relies heavily on continuous integration, where developers frequently integrate their changes into the main codebase. This ensures that code is constantly tested and validated, reducing the likelihood of integration issues and conflicts.</li>
          <li><strong>Mainline as the Single Source of Truth:</strong> The mainline/trunk is considered the single source of truth for the project. All developers actively work on the same codebase, reducing the complexity that arises from maintaining multiple long-lived branches.</li>
          <li><strong>Feature Flags:</strong> Feature flags are often used in TBD to control the visibility and activation of new features. By using feature flags, developers can merge incomplete or experimental code into the mainline without affecting the overall stability of the software.</li>
          <li><strong>Short-Lived Branches:</strong> Instead of creating long-lived feature branches, TBD encourages developers to work on short-lived branches that are quickly merged into the mainline. This approach minimizes the time between feature development and integration, reducing the risk of merge conflicts.</li>
          <li><strong>Continuous Delivery (CD):</strong> Trunk-Based Development complements continuous delivery practices. By integrating changes frequently, the mainline is always in a releasable state, enabling teams to deploy new features or bug fixes rapidly.</li>
          <li><strong>Test Automation:</strong> TBD relies on extensive test automation to ensure that the codebase remains stable and reliable. Automated tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, are crucial for quickly identifying and resolving issues introduced during integration.</li>
          <li><strong>Collaboration and Communication:</strong> TBD promotes collaboration and effective communication among developers. Since everyone works on the same codebase, it encourages developers to communicate frequently, share knowledge, and resolve conflicts together.</li>
          <li><strong>Code Reviews:</strong> Code reviews play a vital role in TBD. Developers review each other's code to ensure code quality, identify potential issues, and maintain consistency across the codebase. Regular code reviews help catch bugs and improve the overall quality of the software.</li>
          <li><strong>Rollbacks and Feature Toggles:</strong> TBD incorporates rollback mechanisms to quickly revert changes in case of unexpected issues. Feature toggles allow features to be easily activated or deactivated, providing the ability to roll back a new feature if necessary without affecting the stability of the system.</li>
        </ul>

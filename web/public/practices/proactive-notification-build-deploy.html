      <h1>Proactive Notification on Build & Deployment</h1>
      <div class="meta">Proactive notification in the software engineering context refers to the practice of actively informing relevant stakeholders about the status and progress of the build and deployment process. This approach helps ensure that all stakeholders are kept informed and can take appropriate actions as necessary.</div>

      <section id="key-aspects">
        <h2>Key aspects covered by the practice</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Automated Build and Deployment:</strong> Proactive notification relies on automated build and deployment processes. These processes should be well-defined, efficient, and capable of generating notifications at various stages. Automated tools such as continuous integration (CI) servers and deployment pipelines are typically employed to achieve this.</li>
          <li><strong>Real-time Status Updates:</strong> Proactive notification involves providing real-time status updates on the build and deployment process. This includes information about build initiation, progress, success, or failure. These updates are crucial for stakeholders to stay informed and take necessary actions promptly.</li>
          <li><strong>Customizable Notifications:</strong> Different stakeholders may have varying levels of interest and responsibility in the build and deployment process. The proactive notification system should allow customization of notifications to ensure that each stakeholder receives relevant information tailored to their needs.</li>
          <li><strong>Event-driven Triggers:</strong> Notifications should be triggered by specific events in the build and deployment process. For example, notifications can be sent when a build is initiated, when it succeeds, when it fails, or when it is deployed to different environments. These triggers ensure that stakeholders are notified at critical points and can respond accordingly.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-channel Communication:</strong> Proactive notifications should be delivered through multiple communication channels to reach stakeholders effectively. This can include email notifications, instant messaging platforms, project management tools, or dedicated notification systems. Using multiple channels increases the likelihood that stakeholders will receive and respond to the notifications promptly.</li>
          <li><strong>Error and Exception Handling:</strong> The proactive notification system should include error and exception handling mechanisms. If any errors or exceptions occur during the build or deployment process, notifications should be sent immediately to relevant stakeholders. This enables quick response and resolution of issues.</li>
          <li><strong>Reporting and Analytics:</strong> A proactive notification system should provide reporting and analytics capabilities. This allows stakeholders to track and analyze historical data, identify trends, and gain insights into the build and deployment process. Such information can be used to improve the overall software development lifecycle.</li>
        </ul>

      <h1>Version Control</h1>
      <div class="meta">A critical practice to manage and track source code changes</div>

      <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Version control is a critical best practice in software engineering that helps manage and track changes to source code and other project assets over time. It enables collaboration among developers, facilitates bug tracking, and provides a safety net for code changes.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="key-aspects">
        <h2>Key aspects covered by the practice</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Repository management:</strong> Establish a centralized repository to store the project's source code and related files. Popular version control systems include Git, and Mercurial. Ensure the repository is distributed, accessible, well-organized, and appropriately secured.</li>
          <li><strong>Branching strategy:</strong> Use branching to create independent lines of development. Main branches, such as "master" or "main," represent stable and deployable code. Feature branches allow developers to work on specific features or fixes without affecting the main branch. Adopt a branching strategy that suits the project's needs, such as GitFlow or GitHub Flow.</li>
          <li><strong>Commit frequently and meaningfully:</strong> Commits are atomic units of change in version control systems. Encourage developers to make frequent granular commits that represent logical changes. Each commit should be self-contained and focused on a specific task or feature. Include meaningful commit messages that describe the changes made.</li>
          <li><strong>Pull requests/code reviews:</strong> Incorporate a code review process through pull requests. Developers propose changes in a separate branch, and peers review the code before merging it into the main branch. Code reviews improve code quality, maintainability, and help catch errors before they are merged into the main codebase.</li>
          <li><strong>Maintenance of the commit history:</strong> The commit history gives a greater reflection on the code management practices of the team and help in the activities like linear commit history maintenance which would help in deploying hotfixes, feature roll-back, cherry-picking and cleaner branch management.</li>
          <li><strong>Merge and conflict resolution:</strong> When merging changes from one branch to another, conflicts may arise if different changes affect the same lines of code. Encourage developers to resolve conflicts promptly by understanding the changes made and merging them appropriately. Automated merge tools can assist in resolving conflicts.</li>
          <li><strong>Version tagging:</strong> Tagging provides meaningful names or labels to specific versions of the codebase. Use tags to mark significant milestones, releases, or versions that are deployed to production. Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a popular convention for version numbering.</li>
          <li><strong>Backup and disaster recovery:</strong> Version control systems act as backups by storing the entire history of the project. Regularly back up the repository to a remote location or cloud storage to ensure disaster recovery capabilities. Consider employing additional backup strategies to safeguard against data loss.</li>
          <li><strong>Documentation and collaboration:</strong> Leverage version control to document changes, collaborate, and track discussions. Encourage the use of commit messages, issue tracking integration, and code review comments to provide context and improve knowledge sharing within the team.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Risks of not implementing Practice</h2>
        <table>
          <thead><tr><th>Risk Number</th><th>Title</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>VCR-1</td><td>Loss of code and history</td><td>Without version control, there is no systematic way to track changes made to the codebase. This increases the risk of accidental deletions, overwrites, or irreversible changes, leading to the loss of valuable code and project history.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>VCR-2</td><td>Lack of code integrity</td><td>Without version control, it becomes challenging to maintain code integrity. Multiple developers working simultaneously may overwrite each other's changes, leading to conflicts and inconsistencies in the codebase. Tracking down and resolving these issues becomes time-consuming and error-prone.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>VCR-3</td><td>Inefficient collaboration</td><td>Version control facilitates collaboration among developers by providing a centralized platform to share and manage code. Without it, collaboration becomes chaotic, with developers manually exchanging code files or using shared network drives. This can result in confusion, duplicated efforts, and difficulty in tracking who made what changes.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>VCR-4</td><td>Difficulty in bug tracking and regression issues</td><td>Version control systems help identify the exact changes that introduced bugs or caused regressions. Without this capability, debugging becomes more challenging, as it is harder to isolate the code changes responsible for issues. This can lead to prolonged debugging cycles and increased time to fix bugs.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>VCR-5</td><td>Limited code review and quality assurance</td><td>Code reviews are crucial for maintaining code quality, identifying potential issues, and ensuring adherence to coding standards. Without version control, it becomes difficult to conduct code reviews effectively, resulting in lower-quality code, increased technical debt, and a higher probability of introducing bugs.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>VCR-6</td><td>Lack of traceability and auditing</td><td>Version control provides a historical record of changes made to the codebase, including who made the changes and why. This traceability is essential for auditing purposes, compliance requirements, or investigating issues. Without version control, it becomes challenging to establish accountability and understand the context of past code changes.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>VCR-7</td><td>Increased deployment risks</td><td>Version control helps manage different code versions, branches, and releases. Without it, deploying updates or rolling back changes becomes error-prone, as there is no systematic way to track and manage code versions. This can result in deployment failures, production issues, and difficulties in reverting to stable versions.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>VCR-8</td><td>Limited scalability and parallel development</td><td>Version control enables parallel development by allowing multiple developers to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously. Without it, coordination becomes cumbersome, and developers may inadvertently overwrite each other's changes. This hampers scalability and slows down the development process.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>VCR-9</td><td>Lack of backup and disaster recovery</td><td>Version control systems act as a backup by storing the entire history of the project. Not implementing version control means losing this backup capability, making it difficult to recover from accidental data loss, hardware failures, or other disasters.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>VCR-10</td><td>Decreased productivity and efficiency</td><td>Overall, the absence of version control hampers productivity and efficiency in software development. It leads to manual and error-prone processes, increased time spent on resolving conflicts and tracking changes, and a higher likelihood of introducing bugs or regressions.</td></tr>

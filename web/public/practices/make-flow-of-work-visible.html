      <h1>Make Flow of Work Visible to Team and Customer</h1>
      <div class="meta">Making the flow of work visible to team members and customers is the practice of providing real-time visibility into the status of work items, such as user stories, defects, or tasks, throughout the software development lifecycle. This approach enables teams to prioritize work, track progress, and communicate effectively with customers, improving overall customer satisfaction and team efficiency.</div>

      <section id="key-aspects">
        <h2>Key aspects covered by the practice</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Kanban/SCRUM Boards:</strong> Utilizing Kanban/SCRUM boards is a popular method to visualize the flow of work. It involves dividing the software development process into distinct stages or columns, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed." Each task or user story is represented as a card that moves across the columns as it progresses, making it easy to track the status of individual tasks and the overall workflow.</li>
          <li><strong>Task Tracking Tools:</strong> Employing task tracking tools, such as Jira, Trello, or Asana, enables teams to record and manage tasks efficiently. These tools provide a centralized platform where team members can create, assign, and track tasks. The visibility of task statuses helps team members and customers understand which tasks are in progress, completed, or awaiting action.</li>
          <li><strong>Real-time Communication:</strong> Effective communication is crucial for making the flow of work visible. Teams should have regular stand-up meetings or huddles to discuss progress, address any obstacles, and share updates. Additionally, using communication tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams fosters continuous collaboration and enables team members and customers to stay informed about the project's progress.</li>
          <li><strong>Information Radiators:</strong> Displaying project-related information on physical or digital boards, known as information radiators, is an excellent way to make the workflow visible to everyone involved. These boards may include project timelines, burn-down charts, task boards, or metrics on key performance indicators. By placing them in shared spaces or online platforms, teams and customers can easily access and understand the project's status.</li>
          <li><strong>Regular Demonstrations and Reviews:</strong> Conducting regular demonstrations or reviews with the customer helps maintain transparency and align expectations. These sessions provide an opportunity for the customer to observe and provide feedback on the work completed, ensuring that the project is progressing in the desired direction. By involving the customer in this process, any potential misunderstandings or misalignments can be identified and addressed early on.</li>
          <li><strong>Feedback Loops:</strong> Establishing feedback loops with the customer and within the development team is crucial for continuous improvement. By seeking feedback on completed work, teams can identify areas for enhancement, optimize their processes, and ensure they are delivering value to the customer. Open channels of communication enable the team and customer to collaborate and refine the workflow based on shared insights.</li>

      <h1>Shift Left on Quality</h1>
      <div class="meta">Shift Left on Quality is a best practice in software engineering that emphasizes early and continuous involvement of quality assurance throughout the software development lifecycle. Traditionally, quality assurance activities were performed towards the end of the development process, but with the shift left approach, these activities are moved earlier in the lifecycle, starting from the requirements gathering phase and continuing throughout design, development, and testing. This practice helps identify and rectify defects and quality issues earlier, leading to improved overall software quality and reduced costs.</div>

      <section id="key-aspects">
        <h2>Key aspects covered by the practice</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Early Defect Detection:</strong> By involving quality assurance activities early in the development process, defects and quality issues are identified and addressed at an early stage. This prevents the propagation of issues and reduces the cost and effort required to fix them later.</li>
          <li><strong>Collaboration and Communication:</strong> Shift Left on Quality promotes collaboration between developers, testers, and other stakeholders. It encourages open communication and knowledge sharing, ensuring that everyone is aligned on quality goals and requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>Test-Driven Development (TDD):</strong> TDD is an integral part of Shift Left on Quality. It involves writing tests before writing the code. This approach helps in designing cleaner code, validating requirements, and preventing defects. The focus is on building quality into the software from the start.</li>
          <li><strong>Automation and Continuous Integration:</strong> Automation plays a crucial role in Shift Left on Quality. Automated testing frameworks and tools are used to streamline and speed up the testing process. Continuous integration practices ensure that tests are run frequently, providing quick feedback on the quality of the software.</li>
          <li><strong>Code Reviews and Static Analysis:</strong> Regular code reviews and static analysis are performed throughout the development process to catch potential issues such as coding errors, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks. This helps improve code quality and prevents defects from reaching the later stages of development.</li>
          <li><strong>Requirements Validation:</strong> Quality assurance activities are involved in the requirements gathering phase to ensure that the requirements are clear, complete, and testable. This early validation helps in identifying any ambiguities or inconsistencies, reducing rework and retesting efforts later.</li>
          <li><strong>DevOps and Continuous Delivery:</strong> Shift Left on Quality aligns with DevOps principles and continuous delivery practices. It emphasizes the integration of quality assurance processes into the continuous delivery pipeline, enabling rapid and frequent releases while maintaining high software quality.</li>
        </ul>

            <tr><td>SLQA-12</td><td>Lower Code Quality</td><td>Without early involvement of quality assurance, code quality may suffer. Absence of code reviews, static analysis, and other quality checks can lead to poor coding practices, lack of adherence to coding standards, and the introduction of avoidable defects.
